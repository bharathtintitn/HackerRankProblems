nking about future creates tension, thinking about past makes us feel nostalgic. Present is what we have, now enjoy it. This is principle told by many individuals to motivate people. In my opinion, I agree we should be aware of what is happening in present. Also, need to plan for future. 

Present is all we have make most out of it. Main advantage of living in the moment is focus and overcoming procrastination. Many scientist and researchers have found out that, humans use only 1% or 2% of they brain. This percentage can be improved by practicing focus. Also, having focus on tasks and work to be completed, will help us in overcoming procrastination habit, which is holding many young adults to complete the task they have. Focus can solve and help people to grow.

Planning for future will help our future self. Nobody can predict, what is going to happen in future. But, that doesnâ€™t mean, we enjoy all our pay checks now, and save nothing for retirement. If we do that, we will not have energy to work nor money to survive. This is can be dangerous situation for any individual. Hence, planning about future is very important.

To conclude, Living life in present movement and enjoying it is important, along with that we need to think about our tomorrow, and plan for our better health and retirement
